## Introduction
This repository is designed to be a resource for all levels of programmers. Whether you're a beginner just starting out or an experienced developer looking for a refresher, you'll find valuable insights and examples here. Each code sample is accompanied by detailed notes that explain the underlying concepts and the code itself.

## Data Structures
Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data. Here, I cover a variety of data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack, Queue, Trees, Hashing, Graphs, and more.

## Algorithms
An algorithm is a set of steps of operations to solve a problem performing calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks. An algorithm is an efficient way to solve a problem and to understand the concept of algorithms, here I cover a variety of algorithms like Searching, Sorting, Hashing, and Graph Algorithms.

Searching Algorithms: Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. 

Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The algorithm works by keeping track of the shortest distance from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph. It does this by setting the initial distance to the starting node as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity. Then, it selects the node with the smallest distance and updates the distances to its neighboring nodes. It repeats this process until it has visited all nodes in the graph.

Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm : The KMP Algorithm is a string matching algorithm, which is used to find occurrences of a “word” within a “text”. It does this by precomputing a table of the word’s prefixes and suffixes, and using this table to skip ahead when matching fails. The key idea in the algorithm is to avoid comparing a character in the text that I know will anyway match. This allows the algorithm to have a linear time complexity.

These are just two examples of the many algorithms you’ll find in this repository. I cover a wide range of topics, from basic sorting and searching algorithms to more complex graph and string algorithms. Each algorithm is accompanied by a detailed explanation in plain English to help you understand how it works. I hope you find this repository to be a valuable resource in your programming journey!
